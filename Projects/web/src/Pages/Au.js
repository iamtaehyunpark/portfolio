The Australian National Assembly recognized the breed in 1963, and the AKC recognized the standard in 1980. Currently, the number of breeders is increasing in the United States and the United Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">general appearance</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">General appearance is a working dog with a powerful, compact, and balanced body, and the ability to complete tasks entrusted under any difficult conditions. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A body composed of strength, balance, and strong muscles should give off the impression of agility, strength, and strong endurance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">personality / habits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cat's loyalty and protective instincts are perfect for herders, ranches, and livestock.
