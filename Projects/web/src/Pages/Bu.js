There is a theory that the ancestral dog was created from a mastiff or a hybrid of a Tibetan Mastiff and a native English dog. There is a theory that the mastiff was created from a bulldog, but it is not clear. There are not a few people who consider Arant, an extinct ancient dog, to be the ancestor dog. It is said that it was a breed with a low body height, a thick head, a short nose, a short body, a developed top, and a vigorous fighting spirit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">During the reign of King John of England from the late 12th century to the first half of the 13th century, the breed became popular after Earl William Warren used it in competitions against bulls, and was consistently improved as a bullfighting dog until it was banned by law in 1815. Bull refers to a bull, and as a dog fighting bulls, it came to be called a bulldog. After being banned by law, its popularity declined for about 50 years, but in the meantime, breeders who have been immersed in this breed have improved its body shape and personality, and it has been revived and called the British national dog. Currently bred as a domestic dog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">general appearance</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The coat is smooth and thick.

Dogs exhibiting respiratory problems are highly undesirable. The body is short and stocky without any tendency to enlarge. The limbs are strong, muscular and sturdy. He has good strength at waist height and looks a bit light compared to his heavy weight.

When viewed from the front, from the tip of the lower jaw to the top of the skull, it looks quite long, wide and square. The cheeks are fairly round and nicely springy. Viewed from the side, the head is fairly high and short from the back of the head to the tip of the nose. The forehead is flat, and the skin of the crown or head is loose and finely wrinkled, but not conspicuous and does not extend over the face. The bony processes of the anterior part are prominent, wide and square. It is set high and has a deep and wide groove between the eyes. There is a wide, deep forehead groove from the stop to the middle of the skull. It can reach the top of the head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As for the facial part, it is short from the front of the cheekbones to the nose, and the skin is wrinkled. The muzzle is short, wide, and rolled up, so it is quite deep from the eyes to the mouth. The nose and nostrils are large, wide and black. Under no circumstances should it be lever, red or brown. The tip of the nose slopes back towards the eyes. The length from the stop to the tip of the nose must not exceed the length from the tip of the nose to the tip of the lower lip. The nostrils are large and widely spaced, with a distinct vertical line between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The upper lip is thick and wide, hanging down and quite deep. It completely covers the sides of the lower jaw, but should not drape over the front. It also completely encloses the teeth together with the lower lip from the front. The jaws are broad, strong and square. The lower jaw protrudes forward and is curled upward. When viewed from the front, the various characteristics of the face are equally balanced on the left and right with an imaginary line as the boundary when the half of the face is divided into equal parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eyes</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Viewed from the front, the skull is low and set well away from the ears. Both eyes and stops are in a straight line and perpendicular to the groove on the forehead. The space between the eyes is widely spaced, but the outer edge of the eyes should not exceed the outer line of the cheeks. They are round in shape, medium in size, not too immersed or protruding, and very dark, almost black in color. When looking straight ahead in the center, the white should not be visible. Also, there shouldn't be any obvious problems with the eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">ear</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The roots of the ears are high (when viewed from the front), and the front ends of each ear join each outer line on the top of the skull and are quite apart, as far as possible from the eyes and attached high. The ears are small and thin and are properly called rose ears. As a whole, it is folded inward and laid back, and the top or front of the inner line of the ear makes a curve to the outside and the rear, exposing a part of the inner part of the facing wheel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Mouth</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The jaw is wide and square, and there are 6 small incisors between the canines. The canines are widely spaced apart. The teeth are large and strong, but are not visible when the mouth is closed. When viewed from the front, the lower jaw is at the bottom of the upper jaw and is parallel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">neck</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Moderate length, strictly speaking, short, fairly thick, thick, and strong.

The back is short and strong, with broad shoulders. The waist is relatively narrow. From just behind the shoulders (the lowest part), it drops slightly down toward the back, and from there it rises up the spine toward the waist (higher than the apex of the shoulders). It then curves rapidly toward the tail, creating an arch (called a roachback). This can be said to be a characteristic of this breed. The body has developed ribs, the abdomen is rolled up, and is not loosely attached.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">tail</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The caudal root is low, relatively straight, and downward.

It sits deep between the forelegs. The chest is broad and the backs of the forelegs are rounded (the sides are uneven and the ribs are well spread). The forelegs are very strong, powerful, muscular and widely spaced. thick and straight. Strictly speaking, the appearance is arch-shaped, but the leg bones are thick and straight, and are not crab legs or bent, and are relatively short compared to the hind legs. However, it is undesirable for the hind legs to be short enough to appear long. Nor is it good to restrict behavior. The elbow is low and set far from the chinbone. The pastern is short, straight and powerful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">hind leg</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The legs are thick and muscular, longer than the front legs, and the waist is elevated. The hock is slightly curved and well directed downward. It is long and muscular from the waist to the hocks, and the midfoot is short and straight, so it has good strength. Knees are rounded and slightly outward from the body. Thus, the hocks are close together and the hind feet are turned outward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">foot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The forelegs are straight and turned very slightly outward.
